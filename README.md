# Random_password_generator
This is the project done by me during my summer intern at EISYSTEMS PVT. LTD.
In this project ,I have used several python libraries like string ,random and tkinter. As soon as you run the command ,you will be requiring to enter the type of the password you want to generate ,basically specifications of the password eg, length of password to be generated, will it include special character or not will it include characters or not , numbers or not.

After running the program , it will give a small pop-up window , to you, which will ask from you the above mentioned specifications.
